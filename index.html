          <h6>
            Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I
            could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted
            to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on
            paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some
            challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I
            saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user
            interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the
            result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

            After several weeks of sticking to this challenge, I learned a lot

          <h6>Start with asking why</h6>
          <p>
            You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
            effective ways of achieving goals.

          <h6>Your ideas will have more value</h6>
          <p>
            By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will
            be fresher and more valuable.

          <h6>Design solutions with love</h6>
          <p>
            Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
            frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

          </div>
          <h6>Share and show your work</h6>
          <p>
            As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
            finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback
            and learn from it.
